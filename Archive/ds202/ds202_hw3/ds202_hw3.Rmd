```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
data(tips, package="reshape2")
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
str(tips)
```

# Total Bill vs Tip, with 15% tip rate line
```{r}
ggplot(tips, aes(x=total_bill, y=tip)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline(slope=.15, intercept=0) + 
  ylim(0, 10)
```

### Notes
* Some bills have very high tip amounts at a low total bill. Some are over 50%
* Vice versa; Some high bills have low tip %

# Customers per Day
```{r}
days <- c("Thur", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")
ggplot(tips, aes(x=factor(day, levels = days))) + 
  geom_bar(width=.5) + 
  xlab("Day") + 
  ylab("# of Customers") + 
  ggtitle("Customers per Day") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Notes
* Friday is the least popular
* Saturday is the most popular
* Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday are popular

# Tip Rate by Gender
```{r}
tips %>% mutate(tip_rate = tip / total_bill) -> tips

ggplot(tips, aes(x=factor(sex, levels=c("Male", "Female")), y=tip_rate)) + 
  geom_boxplot(width=.5) + xlab("Gender") + 
  ggtitle("Tip Rate by Gender") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Notes
* Little difference in tip rates between genders
* Males have the highest outlier

# Tip Rate by Day
```{r}
ggplot(tips, aes(x=factor(day, levels=days), y=tip_rate)) + 
  geom_boxplot(width=.5)
```

### Notes
* Tip rate does not seem to vary much by day
* Weekends have high outliers and higher variance

# Tip Rate, by Smoking Behavior and Gender
```{r}
ggplot(tips, aes(x=tip_rate)) + geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(~sex~smoker) +
  theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank())
```

### Notes
* Smoking increases the ranges of tip rate
* Male smokers tip slightly less than Male non-smokers
* Female smokers tip slightly better than Female non-smokers

# Gender which pays, by day
```{r}
ggplot(tips, aes(x=factor(day, levels=c("Thur", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")), fill=sex)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  xlab("Day")
```

### Notes
* Males and Females pay the bill at similar frequencies on Thur and Fri
* Males pay more often on the weekend
