Mr. Yang's own words:
"
When creating large-scale software, especially from scratch, it's important to architect your infrastucture and software to be scalable.
Thanks to the power of modern cloud technologies, we have the power of serverless computing and microservice architecture to keep our software modular.
Modularity allows developing client and developer tools to be put together like legos, making building from scratch far more manageable.

I believe in the power of User Interface Experience (UIX). Everyone knows the pain of navigating a poorly designed website or application with nonsensical organization.
Thanks to our modular design, client customization is far simpler, as any services provide are inherently separable and integratable.
With this advantage, our clients with will feel like they have full control and understanding of their analytical dashboards.
