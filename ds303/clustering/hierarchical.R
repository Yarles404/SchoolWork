## simulated example where there are truly two clusters

x[1:25,2] <- x[1:25,2] - 4

distM = dist(x)

# dist() using Euclidean distance matrix
# complete linkage

## to determine the cluster labels for each observation associated with a given cut of the dendrogram, we can use the cutree() function: 

cutree(hc.complete,2) # cut tree so we obtain 2 clusters
cutree(hc.average,2)
cutree(hc.single,2)

cutree(hc.single,4)

library("dendextend")
dendro = as.dendrogram(hc.complete)
dendo = color_branches(dendro,k=4) # auto-coloring 4 clusters of branches.
plot(dendo)
